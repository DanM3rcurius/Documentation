# Smart Contract Drafts 
Draft of the contracts employed within the network. The content will be refined and has to pass legal and technical auditions before going live.

## Contract A: Platform <-> Artist *(verification, network fee, copyright, royalties ...)*
- personal **verification** of artist (if remote via zoom) to team, to platform/community; verification hash created for artist; artist can integrate hash into other social media accounts, in order for buyers to verify authenticity of pieces
- a fixed **network fee** is charged to cover for: basic technical infrastruxure, token minting, content storage (ipfs & encryption via Arweave); a fixed service fee is charged to cover for: creation of meta data templates, translation of contract data presentation and copy writing for art pieces, facilitation of "drop"; the service fee revenue is allocated to the (SD@DAO) foundation fund pool
- the **copyright** will always remain with the artist(s) that created that piece; except if at a later stage it will be possible for the artist(s) to decide if and how they want to part with the copyright of a specfic piece

SD® is using IPFS (for decentralized storing) and Arweave (for encryption and pinning), the costs for arewave are covered in the network fee; as long as Arweave is operating the delivery of the content tied to the owenrship is guaranteed.
- **transaction fee(s)** outside of SD® might occur, such as fees for sending funds to buy a piece
- the fixed SD® **network fee** is paid by the buyer
- there are **no returns** for certificates of ownership
- **royalty** status and modalities are set by the artist before "minting" the certificate of ownership; if royalties status is set to active then a certain % of any subsequent re-sale on secondary markets will be rolled back to the creator
