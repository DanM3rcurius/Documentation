### What is SecretDecks®?
*SecretDecks is the soul of the autonomous creator organisation (ACO) we're currently creating. Like a brand to a company, it generates value external to the inherent value of the organisation and can thus help to sustain and nourish it in a transcendental way.*

### Why is SecretDecks®?
*SecretDecks® is acting as the seed or soul catalysing a new kind of endeavour, called a Autonomus Creator Organization - ACO for short.*
