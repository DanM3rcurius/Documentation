## SecretDecks DisCo - Contribution-Survey
[Detailed Expalanation below]
  
## General Information

This provides an overall summary or context of a member, when they became involved and how many days they have worked.
This is supplemented with a contribution vote by peers to capture the more intangible contribution a member has made. 

- Date joined ACO: [Month/Day/Year]
- Hours worked (this month): [00 Hours]
- Local hourly rate in USD: [0 $]  
- [ ] Contribution vote: [@ mention members to review your contributions]

## Work spaces

A member can indicate the different work spaces they have engaged in and provide an estimate of hours worked in each space.
**The spaces are Operations, Website, Governance, Content & Metaverse and Intangible work.**
Intangible work is meant to capture contributions not covered by the scope of a work area.


## Operations 

- hours spent:
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.
  
## Website 

- hours spent:
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.  

## Governance

- hours spent:
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Content & Metaverse

- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

# Peer Review

## Group

After the survey each contribution is assessed for due diligence by members of the appropriate space work squad - to confirm that there is agreement that the work took place etc.

# Reward and evaluation

Once the above process is completed a member may choose either or both to be awarded - 

- [ ] ADA 
- [ ] A recognition Token that simply records the above contribution.

# Cost & Remuneration Calculation
For now we need to calculate manually, this will be upgraded by end of December.
  - [hours worked] * [local hourly rate] = work remuneration
  - other expenses: (please attach invoices)
  - Total amount = work remuneration + other expenses
The ADA/EUR exchange rate will be calculated before funds are distributed

## SeretDecks DisCo - Contribution-Survey

**The key approach is to capture contributions first and assess value last.** 
  Detailed Expalanation below

Why ? Because value led models typically dictate the nature of contributions e.g. a financial incentive contribution model will tend to favor immediate returns, an equal share of rewards upfront will penalize those who have contributed more than others etc.

A contribution led model either tracks or audits ACO member contributions first. Then rewards (in ADA) or recognition (in a Token) are applied to the contribution data afterwards.

## Identity

**This survey encourages DisCo members to identify themselves as it provides a record of their contribution.**

However an anon ID option should be available and peer reviewed per work area.
