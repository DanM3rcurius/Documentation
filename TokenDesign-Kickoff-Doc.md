# Token Design: Kickoff Document
This document could form the start of the documentation towards an initial Token design document for the Autonomus Artist Organization.

# Status Quo
**What's there now:** 
- the mission to create an organization for artists akin to a collective, operating autonomously (AAO) from any central authority or influence. 
- a kickass brand name - SECRETDECKSÂ® - and a splendid product idea and roadmap
- YOU reading this!

# Goal
Create a **DAO like network for artists - an Autonomus Artist Organization (AAO)** that is able to do the following:
- **curate artworks** in a decentralized and autonomus manner (via Token Curated Registry **[TCR]**) 
- P2P creation of **digital collectibles**  
- **authentication** and **sale** of (digital) **artworks** (via Cardano NFT contracts)
- **crowdfund** artists and artworks (via Cardano Smart Contracts)
- **create & organize**: 
  - **digital exhibitions** (1st phase)
  - **virtual augmented** spaces & exhibitions (2nd phase)
  - **virtual reality** spaces & exhibitions (3rd phase) (for renting or selling!)

# Token Design Elements
**TO DO** Define the following properties

## Actors
Who will engage with the token? And when (in what phase/Stage)? Producers/Creators? Prosumers? Consumers? Businesses? Developers? Other third parties?
- creator ("artist")
- collector
- curator
- speculator
- fan
- (lurker)
- "newbie"

## Token Type
What type of token is it? Does it provide access to a digital service? The right to contribute work to a network? The right to vote on governance decisions?
- voting rights within TCR 
- reputation/ID & expertise building

## Network Value
Are the tokens  tied to the value and development of the network? Are tokens linked to key interactions between network participants and the value exchanged over the network?
- each artwork sale on platform takes a network fee of 0.5% - 1,5%

## Token's value creation
What value is pegged to or infused within the token? What's the token facilitating?
- project proposals
- 
- stage/milestone, funding approvals
- 

## Token's value capture
Will network adoption drive demand (price appreciation) for the Token? If not what will?
- regular token burn

## System objective
Whats the main objective of the system? -> *see **GOALS** above* for propositions

## Token design Canvas
coming soon
