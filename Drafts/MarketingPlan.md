## What we use funds for? 
stakepool operation, incubator phase (see [Arcana GitBook for details](https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/the-founders-drop#what-kind-of-lambo-will-we-buy))

## What we want to market?
**Mission:** Elevate Tarot into hyperspace and create tools for knowledge of Self 
<br/>

**First web 3.0 app:** NFT launchpad for original Tarot collectibles with established and emerging artists. These NFTs have a layered utility, for now two are planned: staking and voting rights for curation. 
<br/>

**Details:** First we market the **founders drop** to crypto affine folks that align with the mission, then we incubate the digital artworks for the first two drop and further build out the web 3.0 stack

## How we want to market and to whom?
Founders Drop: to crypto affine folk, remove public Discord links, only allow invites (and whitelist?) via existing members (2 invites per member).
<br/>

Each new member shold be welcomed by an existing member with the founders element animation, a brief overview of the web3.0 ecosystem and tell them about the 2 invites per person rule
<br/>

**Market to whom?** Women and tiktok generation

## Founders Drop incentives
Governance rights redeemable for art curation (in the beginning) and more.

## KPI of MarketingPlan
- [ ] grow Discord server organically to over 1000 members
- [ ] sell all 333 Founder Elements

## Possible actions
- best action: open twitter space talk about tarot, then plugin what we do and founders drop - Vicc
- Tarot resonates more well and is a good onboarding segway for female audience; then mention staking towards the end of communication; then you get a good mix of an audience - Tyler

## TL;DR
**Nutshell:** badass art decks, with staking and governance (community curation) utility 

## Staking 
staking offers gov (art curation) and "conviction" (eligble for exclusive drops) tokens
